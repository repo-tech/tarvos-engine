"""Asset resolution, the one decision a user cannot check by reading the file.

`_asset()` picks a release attachment from the platform. Getting it wrong is
silent and fatal in the worst way: `pip install tarvos` succeeds everywhere, and
the CLI fails only when it is first run, on the machine that needed it. So the
mapping is pinned here rather than left to a release page to reveal.

`_download_binary()` verifies a SHA-256 against the `.sha256` fetched from the
same release. A mismatch must abort and leave nothing behind, because a launcher
that runs an unverified binary is worse than one that refuses to run.
